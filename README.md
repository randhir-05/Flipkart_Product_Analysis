# Flipkart_Product_Analysis
This project provides an in-depth analysis of Flipkart product data, focusing on product pricing, discount patterns, and sales trends. The analysis is carried out using Python for data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The insights are visualized through both Python visualizations and a Power BI dashboard, with an accompanying PDF report summarizing the key findings.

# Key Features:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Managed missing values, outliers, and extracted useful features such as product categories and discount percentages.
Feature Engineering: Created features like discount_percentage and categorized products into groups (Daily Use, Occasional, Luxury).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzed price distributions and trends across product categories
Examined discount patterns and outliers
Conducted time-based sales analysis to understand seasonal or yearly trends
Brand analysis showcasing top-selling and most-discounted products

# Visualizations:
Python Visualizations: Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations for key metrics like price, discounts, and sales trends.
Power BI Dashboard: Developed an interactive dashboard that visualizes key metrics, category-wise insights, time-based trends, and brand performance. Users can filter and drill down into specific segments for deeper analysis.
PDF Report: A detailed PDF report summarizing all analysis steps and key findings is included for easy reference.

# Technologies Used:
Python: For data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For generating exploratory data visualizations.
Power BI: For building an interactive dashboard that presents key findings.
PDF Report: A compiled report summarizing the analysis in detail.

# How to Run:
Clone the repository.
Install the required Python libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Jupyter notebook to perform the analysis and generate Python visualizations.
Open the Flipkart_Analysis_Dashboard.pbix file in Power BI Desktop to explore the interactive dashboard.
After download csv file exchange the path of file with your file distination.
Review the PDF report for a detailed summary of the analysis.

Dataset:
The dataset contains product information from Flipkart, including retail prices, discounted prices, categories, and reviews.
